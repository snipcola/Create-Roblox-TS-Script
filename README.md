## Instructions

1. Ensure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download), and optionally [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), are installed.

2. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install`), only on first set-up.

3. Run `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`), and edit the code in `src`. <br/>
Or alternatively, run `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`) to build once.

4. The compiled script will be outputted to `dist`.

## Configuration

You can configure the AI via `src/.config.json` - **don't forget to set your OpenAI API key there.**
